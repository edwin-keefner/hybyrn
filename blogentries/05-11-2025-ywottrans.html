                    <p>
                        The website <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/" target="_blank">Your World of Text</a> is one massive text document that is open to everyone on the internet. When you first 
                        open the page, you will be greeted with the hell that is the YWOT main page. Right at 0, 0 you will see one of the only parts of the website that isn't available for user editing, a small rectangular 
                        box that will provide some information about how YWOT works and some help if you wish to create your own private page. However the real beauty of this website isn't found within these user 
                        ran spaces, but rather the infinite number of pages that YWOT gives everyone access to. While you can create your own page and have greater control over moderation, as you can control who can 
                        gain access to your page, the same cannot be said for these public spaces. You can access an infinite number of open webpages simply by adding a slash, then literally any word you can think of after it. 
                        <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/vsauce" target="_blank">yourworldoftext.com/vsauce/</a>, <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/carseatheadrest" target="_blank">yourworldoftext.com/carseatheadrest/</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/hybyrn" target="_blank">yourworldoftext.com/hybyrn/</a>, literally anything you can think of. The only barrier to entry is your ability to think of a word to put in. I mentioned 
                        in the blog prior to this, <a href="https://hybyrn.vercel.app/blogentries/05-10-2025-whywebsite.html" target="_blank">Why Make a Website?</a> the YWOT that my friend Jacholis made, 
                        <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/Theworldwontendtomorrow" target="_blank">Theworldwontendtomorrow</a>. I forget exactly when he first started writing onto the page, but within the however 
                        many months the page has been active, he formed an amazing little space on the internet full of people who literally don't know each other (except for the people that do but forget about them oops) who made a 
                        sprawling message board of beautiful aimless thoughts and ideas. I'm sure there are other places on the internet that allow for similar things to occur, but yourworldoftext just has something special about it (though 
                        i guess i wouldn't know if anything else is better). This comes from the pure anonymity and power that the user has. Finding somewhere that hasn't been completely taken over by literal nazis or ywot griefers, feels 
                        like you've stumbled upon a safe haven. I get this warm feeling in my chest whenever I just look up a topic, as I said before it literally could be anything, maybe an artist, a book, a game, a hobby or even a subject in school, 
                        and I find people there all having a conversation. All of these people who just so happened to have the same spontaneous idea, to look this one word up, and then stumble into this community of people who have done the same thing. 
                    </p>  
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I guess this leads into the main reason why I started writing about yourworldoftext, anyone who finds themselves on one of these pages is there because of one of these words, and in terms of the 
                        <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/trans" target="_blank">yourworldoftext.com/trans/</a> page you get people who are trying to find community with people of shared experience and other people who want 
                        those people dead. I'm not going to entertain the idea that these people who looked up the word trans into ywot for the purpose of spreading hate are also there to find a shared community of fellow transphobes. 
                        If those people want to find others who share their common interests they can go onto 4chan or the main page of Elon Musk's twitter when you first make a new account. 
                        Let us have our common spaces to talk to each other without getting told to kill ourselves. Back to the page, because I'm in a never ending journey to steal as much of Jacholis' swag as possible 
                        I was really interested when he sent me a link to the ywot trans page explaining how he spent his time cleaning up some of the hate that was on the page. 
                        When I found time to check out the page I saw that some of the hate was back. There was a pretty ASCII scene that someone had made with a house and some cute creatures and everything, surrounded by a slurs someone 
                        with a very limited dictionary had written. I then proceded to take the next few minutes deleting all the hateful speech on the page then going on with my day. I kept the page open as a tab in my browser, so whenever 
                        I was on my computer I found myself periodically checking the page to ensure that everything was sufficiently hate free. Almost every time there would be some new messages, from how they were worded I'm pretty sure just the same dude who 
                        was keeping the page open so he could use it as a catalyst to fuel his unhappy state of mind whenever he wanted to. Whole paragraphs sometimes. I've been going for maybe a week now? Not very long at all, but enough time to 
                        think about if there is any purpose in maintaining this space. There is enough hate in the world to counteract any of my efforts, and the page is left a skeleton of what it used to be even just a week ago. The house 
                        has been deleted with all the creatures that made their home in the are surrounding it too. All that remains as of today (5/11/2025) is a small stick figure who someone endearingly named shit (like the feces i suppose but we can only guess)
                        and the border the house used to reside in.

                        And I suppose it is truly pointless to try and clean up this page. Me and this (incredibly racist) person at the other end of deep sea cable I don't think will ever be on the same page. Any janitorial efforts made 
                        certainly won't change any minds, won't start a revolution, and probably won't even last for more than 24 hours. This entire process could even be considered performative. Me and this random stranger are both being 
                        performative, him yelling at a wall and me wiping the wall of the spit left behind from his screaming fit. 
                        Maybe we are the same, two people just too focused on the little bits of text on our monitors. But the way I like to see it is that 
                        at the end of the day this stranger is driven by nothing except this perverse hate toward people who want nothing except to live their damn life. And by comparison, me on the other end acting out of some sort of endearment I hold for this website. Knowing how 
                        digitally pulchritudinous (i learned a new word) it can be in the absense of hate. People finding a little space of internet made for them. Maybe we can find our space somewhere else, 
                        but fuck that. Why should we extend our hospitality toward hate? As far as I'm concerned the website behind the link <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/trans" target="_blank">https://www.yourworldoftext.com/trans</a> is a space for trans people. And always has been.  
                        The perk of being a digital janitor in this situation is knowing there's a chance a likeminded individual out there is going to happen upon a website where anyone can type anything, and to put it simply I would rather this person find a stick figure that apparently goes by the name shit (like the feces we think) and not get told to kill themselves. 
                        I think that would make the world a little bit of a better place.
