                      I wanted to talk just about some of the things that I have been doing recently and some of the things I have been thinking about recently!!
                      To start I want to talk about my youtube home page, which over these past few weeks have been insufferable. But like in a good way. It is 
                      jam packed with a million videos about Linux, and sort of everything that is usually tied into Linux in some way. Recently I've been getting some stuff
                      about self hosting and taking back your services from google, which I have been into but I'll need to give myself a little bit more experience using Linux before
                      I try and delve into self hosting. (Also I don't want to use the extra laptop I have for a server but I'll talk about that later). On top of this self hosting stuff
                      in the many hours that I spent watching youtube these past few weeks, I have also been getting some stuff about productivity. Linux sort of gives you the blank slate 
                      needed to make yourself productive so I can see how they are related. Anyway, at the risk of sounding like a copy and paste linkedin post, I'm going to talk about 
                      some things that I have done recently that honestly have just been making me feel better and more productive. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I am an ill person. I wake up late, I don't eat enough meals, and I am addicted to cheap dopamine that is easily accessible through my phone. I have been slowly trying
                      things to try and just make myself more productive, and get me off of my phone. In my "moments of clarity" when I truly have the option to sit and think about things, I 
                      try to take initiative and do something that will make it harder for me next time to easily fall into the trap of short form content. I don't know where I started, but 
                      one of the first steps was probably just uninstalling apps that I don't need. I don't use instagram to communicate with my friends, so I removed it. I didn't use instagram
                      Reels, but now I wouldn't even have the option to. I began clicking the three dots at the top right of the Youtube shorts container and clicking the "show fewer shorts"
                      option. I removed all of the shortcuts on my phone (I use an android so they are still one swipe away but just not having them there when I open my phone is nice). I spent
                      the time controlling notifications through my settings. I switched from Chrome to Firefox Focus on my phone, which is just firefox but it doesn't save any history so I
                      don't have a million tabs open on my phone. I have a timer that I have to wait through whenever I want to get into an app like twitter (which i still use). 
                      I feel like I'm sounding like a self help guru. I think there's a sort of stigma against this stuff, just because of where this sort of advice comes from. 
                      This sort of advice comes from people who have this air of superiority, that they are better because they do these little stupid things. I really don't want to come 
                      from that same sort of platform, but like this stuff really does just make you less useful. I think if you ask most people whether or not they just feel "stupider" 
                      or less creative than they were when they were younger, they would say yes. I really do believe that our access to this infinite stream of content is the reason behind this.
                      Not all of it is bad, the reason I wanted to write this blog today was because I saw a video from Hank Green on the vlogbrothers channel that was literally about this, and
                      tied into some of the things that I have been thinking about recently. The video is called:
                      <a href="https://youtu.be/9euKCrTyMEc?si=HsKU4TIwf6wAPwRT" target="_blank">You're Not Addicted to Content, You're Starving for Information</a> In the video, he does
                      accept the value having access to this infinite stream of content, that not all of it is bad. That all of this content is like food (hence the "starving" mention) and that we live in a world full 
                      of empty calories. Stuff like short form content, information, but information that only keeps your brain activated for a few seconds before you move onto the next little bit.
                      You're eating, but you still feel hungry. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Again, I don't want to come to you with an air of superiority. Maybe you don't want this at all, maybe you feel fine or think you feel fine and would really rather
                      not go through the trouble of doing anything. What would you even do if you weren't on your phone? But if you make this decision, I want you to make it fully as your own.
                      Do you really feel this way? Or is this just your default way of thinking? I think that we don't allow ourselves to be bored, we are fed these cheap thrills that keep
                      our minds active on nothing and we don't go through life learning anything. I personally, want to feel capable, loved, and fulfilled. (the love part has nothing to do with this 
                      it's just part of my personal doctrine) On the other side of the phone, is a team of scientists and programmers working at meta, or google that have been tasked with keeping
                      user retention as high as possible. They want you engaged for as long as possible because that's how they earn their money. I am not better than you because I personally
                      shun myself for using social media or watching short form content, I'm not completely free all I've done is created a negative stigma around doing these things. We are all
                      just victims of these corporations in this hyperconnected information era and truly, it is not our faults. We can do things to fight against them, in our moments of clarity
                      when we are not just running on autopilot, where we open up instagram without thinking and begin scrolling. Don't be scared to be bored, genuinely. You can just sit there and
                      have only your thoughts to stimulate you. Because eventually you are going to think of something to do, that isn't scrolling on social media, and you are going to do it. Then 
                      after you do this thing that you wanted to do, you're going to feel pretty damn good about it. Also I'm not here trying to say phone bad, I'm only a little bit trying to say that.
                      The internet is actually a beautiful thing and there is truly good information out there. I am shunning not this, but the cheap entertainment that our phone gives us. 
                      We literally payed for our phone, it should work for us.
                    </p>

                      As always, I feel like I have been totally scatterbrained this entire blog, but I hope that you still enjoyed it nonetheless. If you didn't I'm sorry there's no place for feedback, 
                      though I suppose that is the beauty of a statically written website. If you feel different, maybe write a blog? I will reread this and I will probablly append more thoughts
                      but for now thanks for reading.
