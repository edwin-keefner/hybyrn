                        I was born in 2007, the year of the iPhone. While I may have been born during the time when GeoCities was still around (at least a little bit) I was definitely born into a computing era 
                        that is defined completely by "Web 2.0", an Internet dominated by large tech companies that receive the majority of traffic on the web. Because of this, it feels strange to say that 
                        I made this website because I felt any kind of nostalgia for a simpler time, as all of my time on the internet since I gained access to it was spent mostly on YouTube watching Minecraft videos. 
                        I really didn't spend my time browsing through any personal websites, blogs, or miniature forums that existed, rather it can be said I was even blind to the mere concept of a personal website.

                        I really made this website after being inspired by two different sources, one was from Aztrosist, and her amazing website <a href="https://insect.christmas/" target="_blank">insect.christmas</a> which 
                        really made me aware of the concept of making your own website. I feel like my home page (on dark mode) also definitely looks a little too inspired by her website, which I apologize for 
                        I swear I'm not trying to steal ur swag (sorry Astrid). I remember seeing some earlier versions of her website, and it has been really cool to see all the small little additions that have been 
                        added as time passes. I have a particular liking for all of the silly little features and small things to interact with on the page, just making the entire page feel so alive and interesting. While I knew 
                        about insect.christmas for a while, I didn't start actually creating a website until a little later than that. That website, is not the same one as you are on right now but rather was a failed 
                        attempt at a blog that was sparked by a wild fluctuation in concentrated motivation. This page however, was mainly inspired by my friend Jacholis, who runs his website 
                        <a href="https://theworldwontendtomorrow.neocities.org/" target="_blank">TheWorldWontEndTomorrow</a>, that is named after a yourworldoftext space by the same name, (check that out 
                        <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/Theworldwontendtomorrow" target="_blank">here</a> this website is so cool). I take it upon myself to steal any Jacholis swag I can get my hands on 
                        (he has a surplus) and this ultimately was what pushed me over the line to make this website.

                        This though, doesn't really fully explain why I am so attracted to the idea of a personal website. I honestly don't know whether this desire was influenced by some sort of nostalgia, 
                        I feel that many people in my generation feel some sort of perverse nostalgia toward a 
                        time before our own, and express this nostalgia through extremely ironic means. If you go on anywhere where shortform content is doled out like oxygen, though I'm mainly thinking about TikTok, there is a never ending slew of content that leans 
                        into these buzzword aesthetics, cottage core, y2k, coquette, dark academia, fairycore, corecore, hopecore, frutiger aero, and hundreds more. Everything just moves so fast, it starts maybe as some brewing form of nostalgia that leads
                        to someone into creating a video to express this nostlagia the only way they know how, TikTok, to eventually evolving into something that companies and people use as a tag under their video to get likes and make money off of. 
                        I guess there's nothing really wrong with it though, the entire reason why nostalgia has become so "mainstream" I'm sure is linked to a general negative sentiment that we as young people all hold toward our future. 
                        A negative sentiment that is fueled by an information age that feeds us knowledge about the different ways that we are fucking up our planet, and a job market that we as the younger generation feel ourselves struggling to grab a hold in. 
                        And because of all of this, we connect ourselves with this prior era through the medium of short form content, as that's simply the way that know to connect with it, and is the only way that works in presenting your thoughts to as many people as possible. 
                        I guess circling back, the reason I made this website is definitely part of this generational nostalgia I feel. Parts of myself, whether I like it or not, have been shaped and molded by what I have consumed and the time I live in. 
                        Parts of my website definitely try and lean into these aesthetics of an old internet, and my idea of a personal website is definitely built upon these aesthetics. But ultimately I know I can't fully make something
                        that truly "gets there", to this old internet. With any form of creation, I think the only way to look is forward. By this I mean that we 
                        inherently live in this age of information and have been molded by it. Our sentiments are truly different than what they were 20 or 30 years ago and anything we create will be made within the context of our modern 
                        era, and parts of this modern era will seep into what we create in some shape or form. Whether appearing within art itself, or playing a part into influencing our thoughts that become our reason to create something 
                        in the first place. To put it simply, we can't truly go back to a time before our own because we can't truly imagine a world where we don't know what the hell corecore is.

                    <p>
                        That doesn't really feel like all of it though, while yeah there is totally this whole massive conversation to be had about the nature of creation and art and all of this, I'm really not smart enough 
                        to say anything that hasn't been said before. I have been influenced by this generational nostalgia, but also by a multitude of other reasons. One reason is probably related to a desire to imitate. 
                        Before making this website I browsed through my fair share of amazing websites found on the main page of neocities and the multitude of webrings within those websites and there's always this desire I feel whenever 
                        I see a really cool website, of just sort of like envy and amazement (something like that unsure if that's the right word to express how I feel). 
                        I felt some sort of emotion looking at this thing that someone made, and I guess it's human nature to also want to express and pass on this emotion to other people. I suppose it's a way of feeling seen. 
                        Of course as some old white guy probably said, "Comparison is the thief of joy". I don't really gain anything from comparing my website to other people's websites or trying to make my website the same 
                        as someone elses. Every time I work on this website I really just want to put more of myself into it, I really want this to be an extension of myself. With my statement I said before, about passing on an 
                        emotion I felt, I suppose validation would be a reason too. I add to this website with the knowldge that someone may see it and (hopefully) think it's cool. Though I don't think that's the full reason, 
                        it may be more of a desire to make something I'm personally proud of, though I know that's a slippery slope if I get into my head enough. Maybe I feel some sort of obligation to work on some sort of project that 
                        involves programming, since I'm supposed to be a computer science major or something. Though I have really enjoyed the programming aspect of making a website so far. I guess I hit it on the nail earlier, since 
                        I fundamentally I do just feel really strongly about just wanting to take parts of myself and burn them into data. In the future, data I can look back on, to see how I thought and felt and give me an 
                        insight into how much things have changed. In the present, to just expose parts of myself to the world. I don't feel like I express myself enough, whether or not my thoughts are valuable or not is up to the 
                        person that reads them (if anyone even does read them), but I do genuinely feel better about putting stuff out there. Nothing even that crazy, just something on my mind in the moment, or even something that has been on my mind for a few months 
                        or a year. I do enjoy myself making this website, and I know I have been saying ultimately and truly a lot but the reason I come back to keep making this website, truly, is because I enjoy it.
