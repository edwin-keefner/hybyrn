                    <p>
                      hi all I was just watching a youtube video by a channel that I find myself coming back to every now and then named Answer in Progress. There are
                      three people that run this channel and each post their own videos that they make (which is super cool to see) but the video that prompted me to start
                      writing about this was made by Sabrina Cruz!!!! I think I have only watched videos made by her on the channel which I also find interesting since I 
                      only end up seeing videos made by her come into my reccomended feed. But that doesn't matter right now!!! As of today (or i guess tonight) 3 days ago the 
                      channel uploaded a video that goes by the title <a href="https://youtu.be/v5YlreKsUGY?si=7yvcrujSMCL09VyV" target="_blank">what is the future of art?</a>.
                      The thumbnail of this video has the ChatGPT logo in it with the caption "slop?", so if you could guess, this video is about ai.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I really just wanted to express my own personal thoughts and beliefs on my own personal doctrine when it comes to ai usage, and really what issues I believe
                      exist, and where I draw the line. Sabrina, in her video, asks this overarching question, which is "what is the value of human art?". Which the answer of is meant
                      to answer another overarching question about the value of ai art in comparison. She interviewed regular people, art critics, art valuers, and artists themselves to try and find the answer to this question.
                      The video is extremely well made and I highly reccomend you give it watch (and maybe some of the rest of their channel). Sabrina took away that she really does see the value
                      in human art, and understands all of the downsides of ai art, yet still finds herself 'okay' with most ai art, and even says that she uses ai art. 
                      Though in the video, when showing examples of her "using" ai art, she just showed herself using certain ai tools that mainly served as ways to edit existing content,
                      and also talked about how she uses ai when programming. Which, arguably isn't the same thing as creating an entire image through a diffusion model. 
                      This lack of distinction got me thinking about what I was okay with in terms of generative ai, and really wasn't okay with. I felt as if a tool in an video editing program
                      to fill space was different than using ai to generate some fucked up piece of garbage in studio ghibli style. (which on top of taking absolutely no effort and requiring little to no vision (in my opinion) is essentially stealing and devaluing real art)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      First off, I am absolutely not okay with full on image generation and video generation from a prompt. Sabrina tried to view the argument from the other side
                      and interviewed an "ai artist" on the topic, in which she felt there was still some human element to the entire process given how the ai artist used her own 
                      personal experiences and didn't use any artwork that wasn't in the public domain, and instead used images that she had created in the past as references. 
                      I'm against this. Despite the "effort" that this specific person put in. I see ai art as skipping all of the nuance and everything that makes the art really valuable.
                      You have the idea, you feel the feelings, you see the vision, then you leave it up to an algorithim to perfectly average out your words into a bunch of pixels. 
                      It feels soulless, it feels loveless. Sabrina divided artistic value into two different axis, one that scaled dependant on how much work and effort was put into the 
                      piece, and another that scaled depending on the entire context of the piece. Obviously little to no effort was put into the actual creation, and I think, at least 
                      the historical context of the piece, will hold no value. This is just based on the sheer volume of ai "art" and the terrible things that people have done with ai art.
                      I am yet to see something positive come with ai image generation. While our government, given enough time (way too fucking long) will eventually regulate ai art 
                      properly, as of now the evil it can do is limitless. Giving anyone the power to ai generate real people in any fucked up situation their brain desires. 
                      I have only seen one somewhat redeeming upside of ai art, to try and see the other side a little bit. I saw a video of someone putting an image of their 
                      mother hugging them into a video generation model, and letting it generate a video of how the scene might've gone. By the way I lied about this being a good thing. 
                      There's something dystopian about this, generating memories. Maybe we're too early for it to matter like that, and maybe I should just let that grown man on twitter
                      enjoy his video with his ai generated mother, but something doesn't sit right about that situation. This is on top of giving the AI and also the company behind the model
                      the data that is a personal photo of someone with their mother. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Onto ai editing tools, I guess it's a little bit of a different story. In Sabrina's video she showed off how she used ai to generate a larger scene around the real 
                      video in order to frame the shot how she wanted. Honestly, this just feels like any other tool that you would find in photoshop (i guess photoshop isn't a video editing software but you know what I mean).
                      Here I really feel that there's no way to use this in any other way except as a tool. The model that is used to generate the extra framing could (and probably is) ran locally
                      on whatever machine is using the software. There are probably a ton of examples of tools very similar to this, and honestly at some point even these probably cross a line.
                      I can't really take any more of a nuanced take on ai tools like this, since I haven't used any really. I feel like we have had stuff similar to this, and maybe I'm wrong here but
                      ai tools like this feel similar to some photoshop tools we have had, and maybe even some of the tools we have to remove backgrounds from images. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Honestly this covers most of what I'm okay with, I haven't really defined a line of what I'm okay with, but I know that the spectrum that this line lies on is defined by 
                      human effort. The more the tool takes away human effort, or devalues human effort, the less I am okay with it. There is a bigger issue I see, which is just the normalization
                      of ai prompt generation. Right now there is definitely a stigma against ai art in some spaces on the internet, but who knows how long that will go on? I truly hope that
                      ai art generation isn't normalized, because if it is normalized, in my mind, we will have lost. Lost meaning a few things here. Losing culture, losing a part of ourselves.
                      And also losing to the corporations that oh so want us to love and use their ai products. I haven't talked about that at all yet but I truly despise this "ai bubble" we're in. 
                      I fucking hate every company who tries to slap the ai label on everything they put out, and I hate how much their stocks rise when they do it. This is real technologly, 
                      large language models truly aren't all bad, there is value in them. But not everything here is good, most of what the consumer is getting I think is terrible.
                      AI art, AI chatbots (there's more to talk about here, I think they can be good in some cases given some assumptions, though how they are marketed and how people have used 
                      AI chatbots up to this point really shows how bad they are. They are just making us stupider.), companies having more of an incentive to track every little thing you do
                      to train these useless chatbots, I see nothing good here. I also really want to talk about the usage of AI in programming, which Sabrina also mentioned in her video.
                      I think honestly that it can be a good tool, maybe if you're more focused on just making something getting something done, but I truly dislike the idea of AI writing code
                      being used in a system that is actually important. Humans write better code. That's what I believe right now. I also believe that AI makes it too easy to do things. It's
                      the easy way out. You don't read all of the explanation behind the code when chatgpt spits it out to you, you copy and paste it into your editor and hope it works. There's
                      no learning here, no growth. I said it can be a good tool, but only in the hands of TRUE professionals, people who actually know what they are doing. People in college shouldn't 
                      be using chatgpt to generate their literally anything. The school system is broken, but you're cheating yourself out of any value you would be getting by having generative ai do
                      everything for you. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I haven't spoken about environmental impacts. I think this is probably a bigger topic that I am not well educated enough on. What I understand is that yes, AI is bad for the environment
                      but not as bad as people think? But also just as bad as people think because the energy that is used to power these servers are in areas that still primarily use fossil fuels.
                      Also AI uses a LOT of water to cool down previously mentioned servers. My take is that you should feel especially guilty generating useless shit. There has been some good 
                      when you consider how we are finally getting some reinvestment into nuclear power in the United States, which is just what we should have been doing. Nuclear power is just
                      amazing, it's clean and it's efficient. Though I dislike that companies are only investing in nuclear power for this entire generative ai hype. We win only slightly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In conclusion, I really don't like it. We normalize ai art, we ruin the lives of millions. Yeah really nuanced I know. Thanks for reading.
